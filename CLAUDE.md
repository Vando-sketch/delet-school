# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.


## Git workflow

Follow this for every implementation task, without waiting to be asked:

1. **Classify the task** as `feat` (new capability), `fix` (bug fix), or another conventional type (`refactor`, `chore`, `docs`, `test`) based on what the diff actually does.
2. **Create a branch** named `<type>/<short-kebab-description>` (e.g. `feat/wardrobe-photo-batching`, `fix/dashboard-auth-bypass`) off the current base branch before making changes. Always create a branch — never commit directly to `main` or to whatever branch you started on.
3. **Implement, test, and commit** on that branch.
4. **Open a pull request** (`gh pr create`) once the work is done and verified (tests + lint pass), targeting the branch you branched from.

### Breaking down larger tasks with subagents

For a task large enough to naturally split into independent subtasks:

Use the delegating-to-agy skill

1. Create your own `<type>/<description>` branch first, as above — this is the integration branch.
2. Split the work into subtasks and dispatch each to a subagent, picking the model per subtask's complexity (e.g. a small, mechanical change → a cheaper/faster model; a subtask requiring deep design or judgment → a stronger model).
3. Each subagent creates its own branch off the integration branch (same `<type>/<description>` naming convention), and independently follows the full workflow above on that branch: implement, test, commit. Subagents do not open their own pull requests and do not merge — only the main agent does.
4. Once a subagent's branch is done, the main agent merges it into its own integration branch, resolving any conflicts.
5. After all subagent branches are merged, the main agent runs the full test suite and lint on the integration branch, then opens the single pull request for the whole task.
